# Face-Recognition-Using-FaceNet

FaceNet is a face recognition system that was described by Florian Schroff, et al. at Google in their 2015 paper titled “FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering.”

The model is trained and tested using the ‘5 Celebrity Faces Dataset‘.

MTCNN model is used for face detection, the FaceNet model will be used to create a face embedding for each detected face, then a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier model is developed to predict the identity of a given face.
